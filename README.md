# dotfiles
Organizing my dotfiles with Ansible

This repo contains all packages and configs needed to setup a computer to my liking.

It contains following roles:

- write-dotfiles        (creates .bashrc and .aliases)
- terminal-packages     (installs all programs not needed in GUI)
- hyprland              (installs the wayland compositor hyperland)
- foot                  (installs the terminal emulator foot)
- waybar                (installs waybar the bar for hyprland)
- greetd                (installs the gui starter)
- yazi                  (installs my favorite terminal file manager)
